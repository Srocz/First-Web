        <p>I decided to take an interest in technology and it quickly became a passion for me I particulary took interest in software development
        and set out to learn as much as I could. It was a minf field at first but found my way to navigate through endless content, I started with
        getting a solid foundation in <strong><em>HTML</em></strong> and <strong><em>CSS</em></strong> I built my first basic website such as this one.
        I also learned <strong><em>Javascript</em></strong> to make my websites more interactive.
        I then moved on to learning <strong><em>Python</em></strong> where I coded some some projects such as a calcultor and password generator
